baby can't you see i'm calling
a guy like you should wear a warning
it's dangerous i'm falling
there's no escape i can't wait
i need a hit baby give me it
you're dangerous i'm loving it
too high can't come down
losing my head spinnin' 'round and 'round
do you feel me now
with a taste of your lips i'm on a ride
you're toxic i'm slippin' under
with a taste of a poison paradise
i'm addicted to you
don't you know that you're toxic
and i love what you do
don't you know that you're toxic
it's getting late to give you up
i took a sip from my devil's cup
slowly it's taking over me
too high can't come down
it's in the air and it's all around
can you feel me now
with a taste of your lips i'm on a ride
you're toxic i'm slippin' under
with a taste of a poison paradise
i'm addicted to you
don't you know that you're toxic
and i love what you do
don't you know that you're toxic
don't you know that you're toxic
taste of your lips i'm on a ride
you're toxic i'm slippin' under
with a taste of a poison paradise
i'm addicted to you
don't you know that you're toxic
with a taste of your lips i'm on a ride
you're toxic i'm slippin' under (toxic)
with a taste of a poison paradise
i'm addicted to you
don't you know that you're toxic
intoxicate me now with your lovin' now
i think i'm ready now i think i'm ready now
intoxicate me now with your lovin' now
i think i'm ready now
