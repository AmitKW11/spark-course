The Life Cycle of a Spark Application (Outside Spark)

- ask the cluster manager (CM) to start driver on one of the nodes.
- the driver asks the CM to start executor processes on the worker nodes.
Now the "spark cluster" is ready to accept work.

Execution: Fig 15-6
The driver and the workers communicate among themselves, executing code and
moving data around. The driver schedules tasks onto each worker, and each worker responds
with the status of those tasks and success or failure.


Completion: Fig 15-7
After a Spark Application completes, the driver processs exits with either success or failure. The cluster manager then shuts down the executors in that Spark cluster for the driver.



The Life Cycle of a Spark Application (Inside Spark)

 " It is important to note that you should never need to use the SQLContext and rarely need to use the SparkContext."
