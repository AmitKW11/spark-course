# What is Spark?

What is horizontal scaling and vertical scaling?

Apache Spark is an open-source cluster computing framework.

Built on top of Hadoop MapReduce.

Utilizes In-memory computing.

Originally developed at UC Berkeley (2009).

# Where to run my Spark server?

In a real production environment, Databricks managed cluster can be used (in the cloud), or MS HDInsight.
We can also install our own Spark cluster, locally or in the cloud.
The number of computers can reach thousands in the cluster.

During this course we will use a minimal installation on your own PC/Mac/linux machine.

Instructions are here: https://github.com/cnoam/spark_local_env/blob/94290/readme.md

# Check yourself
Occasionally, you will have opportunities to check your knowledge. 
Try to answer/solve/execute all the questions. They will help you make sure you are ready for the next part!

* Explain the difference between horizontal and vertical scaling
* Check "Cluster" definition. Does it match what we have in Spark?
